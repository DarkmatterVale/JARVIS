# Noun Attribute Database

## General overview

This research project attempts to build a dynamic database which holds information about terms. This information can vary, from is the term in question tangible to what is the height of the term in question.

To run the experiment, cd to this directory of the code and enter the following command.

```
python database_experiment.py
```

## Stages of the experiment

There are multiple stages to the experiment, each of which is listed below.

- Stage 1
  - Modular database is created
  - Interface class is created to allow manipulation of database
  - Test data is created and inputed into the database to assure its ability to store modular information
- Stage 2
  - User input is added -- Database can learn from simple statements that give objects attributes
- Stage 3
  - User input expanded - can now ask questions
  - "Bot" can respond to questions asked in a limited scope
- Stage 4
