# JARVIS
JARVIS is a personal assistant that can learn and interpret your commands. He should be able to make your life more productive, and he should not annoying. He is simple to use, and all that is required is to type the following command once you cd into the directory:

```
python jarvis.py
```

Please report any bugs or feature requests here on the Github issue tracker.

## Dependencies
There are a couple of dependencies required to run this. First, you must have python ( 2.7.x ) and pip installed.

The remaining dependencies can be downloaded and installed automatically by running the following commands:

```
cd modules
python setup.py
```

## Dependencies included in project

This project includes a number of dependencies. I have not developed these, and do not take any credit for them. Please read specific information about each library. Currently included libraries:

- regex4dummies

Once again, I do not take any credit for these.

## Current Status

Currently, regex4dummies ( https://github.com/darkmattervale/regex4dummies ) is under development. This will assist JARVIS in understanding what you are saying. In addition, it will allow him to learn new things based on patterns identified in text. regex4dummies is planned to be completed by the end of summer 2015. Following its completion, work on JARVIS will resume.

## Building
No building should be required, so you do not need to worry about this. All you need to do is type the above command into terminal to start JARVIS, and voila! Your very own personal assistant!
