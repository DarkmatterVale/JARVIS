If you would like to contribute, please follow the below guidelines. Thanks for the help!

1: Look through the code and the wiki, and get a rough idea of our code styling. When you contribute, it will be key to style
your code in a way that we will be able to understand ( and others can understand as well )
2: Make something useful! No one wants to see an addition that will let JARVIS make toilet flushing noises
3: Have fun! JARVIS should be able to talk to you like a human, and he should help make you more productive

Thanks again for the help!
