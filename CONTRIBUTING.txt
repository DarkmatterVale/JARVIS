If you would like to contribute, please follow the below guidelines.

1: Look through the code and the wiki, and get a rough idea of our code styling. When you contribute, it will be key to style
your code in a way that we will be able to understand (and others can understand as well)
2: Make something useful! No one wants to see an addition that will let JARVIS make toilet flushing noises

Thanks again for the help!
